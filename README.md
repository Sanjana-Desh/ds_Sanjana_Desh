# Trader Behavior & Market Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
Analysis of cryptocurrency trading behavior in relation to market sentiment (Fear & Greed Index) on the Hyperliquid platform.

## Datasets
- Historical Trader Data from Hyperliquid (10,000+ trades)
- Bitcoin Market Sentiment Dataset (Fear & Greed Index)

## Key Findings

1. **Optimal Trading Conditions**: Traders achieve 3.6x higher average profits ($89 vs $25) during Greed sentiment compared to Extreme Greed.

2. **Contrarian Behavior Dominates**: 72.7% of trading activity occurs during Fear markets, demonstrating strong contrarian strategy.

3. **Sentiment Drives Win Rates**: Win rates peak during Greed (44%) and Extreme Greed (49%) periods, dropping to just 31% during Neutral sentiment.

4. **Alt-coin Outperformance**: Alternative cryptocurrencies significantly outperformed BTC (@107: $2.8M, HYPE: $1.95M, SOL: $1.65M vs BTC: $860K).

5. **Concentrated Success**: Top traders generate dramatically higher returns (top trader: ~$2M net profit), with profitability driven by position sizing and risk management.
